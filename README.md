## 🧠 About Me

I'm a **2nd year BS-MS student at IISER Kolkata**, passionate about exploring the mysterious world of **Quantum Mechanics**.  
Currently pursuing foundational physics, I recently completed an internship at **IIT Kharagpur**, where I worked on **simulating vector magnets** as part of a project on electromagnetism.

When I'm not decoding the universe, I'm:
- A part-time **singer**
- A full-time **anime geek** (yes, *TATAKAE!*)

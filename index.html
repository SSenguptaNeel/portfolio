    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <!-- <p>
      Yo! I'm <strong>Swapnaneel Sengupta</strong>, a <strong>2nd year BS-MS student at 
      <a href="https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">IISER Kolkata</a></strong>, 
      currently navigating my way through the incredible world of science. This website is a glimpse into 
      my academic journey, research curiosities, and some creative quirks that make me who I am.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a <strong>19-year-old researcher</strong> fascinated by the mysteries of 
      <strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong>, and hoping to major in <strong>Physics</strong>, 
      with <strong>Chemistry</strong> and <strong>Biology</strong> as my current pre-majors. I‚Äôm also deeply 
      intrigued by <strong>Classical Mechanics</strong> ‚Äî yes, the ‚Äúold school‚Äù stuff people often overlook. 
      There's something fundamentally beautiful and timeless about it that I find incredibly cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside quantum weirdness, I enjoy diving into <strong>organic chemistry</strong>, 
      <strong>genetics</strong>, and everything that makes the physical and living world tick. Recently, 
      during my internship, I got my first real taste of research. <em>(Tough stuff, but incredibly rewarding!)</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Apart from academia, I‚Äôm a part-time <strong>singer</strong> and a full-time <strong>anime geek</strong> 
      (<em>TATAKAE!</em>). Whether it's humming a tune, getting lost in a musical arrangement, or binge-watching 
      an action-packed anime arc ‚Äî these are the little joys that keep me going. For me, <em>peace</em> is sitting 
      by the window on a rainy day and singing melodies of Kishore, Atif, KK, and many more. Oh also ‚Äî being 
      <em>Bengali</em>, I have immense love for food and cuisines (if you wanna grab my attention, just bring me 
      a plate of good biryani).
    </p>

    <p>
      But do I just read books related to all of this? Nah. I find interest in the <strong>Puranas</strong> and 
      <strong>Upanishads</strong> ‚Äî there‚Äôs something truly marvellous in them. I know being a man of science 
      doesn‚Äôt really align with such interests for many, but hey, who cares? I love how every mythological tale 
      is meant to leave a message ‚Äî a timeless wisdom to be passed on. To me, religion exists to embibe virtues 
      such as <em>discipline</em> and <em>righteousness</em> in humans, rather than conflict.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea of being a scientist has fascinated me since childhood ‚Äî the pursuit of asking questions, 
      uncovering patterns, and contributing to something greater than myself is what truly drives me. I don‚Äôt 
      know where this journey will take me, but if I can understand even a small part of this universe and use 
      it to help someone else ‚Äî that‚Äôs enough for me.
    </p> -->

  and a few creative quirks that make me, well, me.

<p>
  I'm a <strong>19-year-old researcher</strong> drawn to the mysteries of <strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong>, 
  and aiming to major in <strong>Physics</strong>, with <strong>Chemistry</strong> and <strong>Biology</strong> 
  as my current pre-majors. I'm also fascinated by <strong>Classical Mechanics</strong> ‚Äî the ‚Äúold school‚Äù physics 
  that still holds a timeless beauty.

<p>
  Outside quantum realms, I love diving into <strong>organic chemistry</strong> and <strong>genetics</strong>. 
  During my recent internship, I got a real taste of what research actually feels like. 
  <em>(Tough stuff, but totally worth it!)</em>
</p><br>

<p>
  Beyond academics, I‚Äôm a part-time <strong>singer</strong> and a full-time <strong>anime geek</strong> 
  (<em>TATAKAE!</em>). From humming melodies on rainy days to losing myself in Kishore, Atif, KK, and anime arcs ‚Äî 
  these little joys fuel me. Also, being <em>Bengali</em>, my love for food is deep. Biryani? I‚Äôm in.
</p><br>

<p>
  I‚Äôm also into the <strong>Puranas</strong> and <strong>Upanishads</strong> ‚Äî ancient texts that offer 
  surprisingly modern wisdom. I believe religion exists to cultivate <em>discipline</em> and 
  <em>righteousness</em>, not division.
</p><br>

<p>
  Since childhood, I‚Äôve dreamt of being a scientist ‚Äî someone who questions, explores, and contributes. 
  Even if I uncover a small piece of this universe and it helps someone else, that‚Äôs enough for me.
</p><br>


    <p><strong>Big dreams, small but steady efforts</strong> ‚Äî one step at a time.</p> <br>
